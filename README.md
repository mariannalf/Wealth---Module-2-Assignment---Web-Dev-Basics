Use the textbook to complete the following: 

1. Wealth Dashboard – 10 marks

   >>> Please complete the end of chapter project for Chapter 4

    Provide complete code for an implementation of the following web page and name the file wealth.html. 
    To make each of the two figures, you can generate a line graph with Microsoft Excel, copy the result to Microsoft Paint, 
    and save the pasted image as a .png file. As an option, feel free to insert a third graph above the other two graphs that 
    shows how the average number of hours worked per week affects retirement wealth.

    In the web page, note the superscripted “[1]” in the third line. That is a link to the message at the bottom of the web page. 
    The W3C recommends implementing a footnote by using a link. The link contents should be a square-bracketed number, and the 
    link should be superscripted. To make the link look good, the web page uses these CSS rules:

    a {color: white; text-decoration: none;}
    a:hover {text-decoration: underline;}
    As always, make sure you use appropriate containers so that your web page’s content is properly defined. 
    In particular, you should include aside, header, article, section, and figure elements.
